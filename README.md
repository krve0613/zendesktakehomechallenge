# zendeskChallenge
The whole idea behind this application is to implement a search API by reading all three json files.
Firstly, I am converting the json files to corresponding java objects(User.java, Organization.java, Ticket.java).
Now I have implemented the REST GET method which accepts one parameter as input value to be searched on and this will call the corresponding methods in the code.
For more details on how to run and use this applications please follow readme-search.md file in the same folder.
